## Installation

To install, please run the following code in the terminal:

```
npm install
```

You will also need to have MongoDB installed on your computer. This readme does not walkthrough the steps to do that, so you will have to look elsewhere online for that information. I am using Robo3T and MongoAtlas for the database applications, but you may use the MongoDB application of your choosing.

## Usage

To use this app, run the following command in the terminal:

```
node server.js
```
